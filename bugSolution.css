The solution might involve several approaches, depending on the desired outcome:

**Approach 1:  Adjusting the Selector Order**

In cases where the specific style on an element with both ID and class are required, the order of selectors does not change the effect.

**Approach 2: Using `!important` (Generally Discouraged)**

While using `!important` can override specificity rules, it's generally discouraged because it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug. Therefore it is not recommended as a solution. 

**Approach 3: Restructuring the CSS**

One possible approach is to restructure your selectors to avoid conflicts. For example, if you want to have more control over the `#myElement` styling you might want to create a more specific selector. 

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; /*This is still more specific than #myElement alone*/
}
```
